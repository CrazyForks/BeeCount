A: Yes, you can switch anytime. The saved custom configuration won't be lost and can be re-enabled.

**Q: How to ensure data security?**
A: We recommend using your own Supabase project, configuring proper access policies, regularly exporting CSV backups, using strong passwords and enabling two-factor authentication.

**Q: What data formats are supported?**
A: Currently supports CSV format for import/export, compatible with data formats from most mainstream accounting apps.

**Q: How to sync data across multiple devices?**
A: Configure the same Supabase URL and anon key on all devices, and log in with the same account for automatic sync.
